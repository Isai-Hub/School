                    <h2>3.<a href="https://www.sftravel.com/things-to-do/attractions/iconic-sf/lombard-street" target="_blank"> Lombard Street</a></h2>
                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <p class="paragraph">Lombard Street ranks as one of San Francisco's most historic thoroughfares, tracing its origins back to the Gold Rush era of the mid-1800s. Established in 1853, it drew its name from Lombard Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The name Lombard is derived from the affluent and flourishing Italian region of Lombardy.</p>
                    <img src="img/lombard-history" alt="Lombard street">
                    <h3>Driving</h3>
                    <p class="paragraph">Drive through San Francisco's twisty road, Lombard Street. The most curviest road in San Francisco with eight harpin turns.
                        Cruising along Lombard Street can be a thrilling adventure, yet it poses its own set of difficulties. The sharp curves and continual stream of visitors render it a pathway that demands precise steering.</p>
                        <h3>Take a Walk</h3>
                        <p class="paragraph">For those who wish to take in the sights without the burdens of driving, the walkways provide a safer, though steep, route to appreciate the street's distinctive layout and breathtaking views. The avenue is exquisitely adorned with florals and greenery, particularly hydrangeas, adding vibrant color against the gray asphalt. This careful landscaping, along with the red-brick pathway, forms a charming tableau, especially during the spring and summer seasons when the blossoms are at their peak.</p>
                        <img src="img/lombard-flowers" alt="flowers">
                    <h3>Safety</h3>
                    <p class="paragraph">The street has greatly caused an appearance in movies and is talked about when mentioning San Francisco, but the question asked is why the road is curved. The answer is for safety. The road is steep and the curves in the street reduce the danger of driving straight.</p>
