                    <img src="img/bridge-1937.jpg" alt="Golden Gate Bridge">
                    <p class="paragraph">A frequently visited bridge offering stunning views of San Francisco, it is renowned for its striking red hue and holds the title of California's most popular landmark.</p>
                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <p class="paragraph">One of the most renowned spans globally was built in 1933 and finished on May 22, 1937, totaling four years of development. This bridge links San Francisco with Marin County. In 1937, it earned the title of the longest span on the planet until 1964, when it was eclipsed by the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in New York City. During the Great Depression, construction crews took advantage of the chance for steady employment, enduring hazardous conditions while constructing the roadway and towers above open water. The Golden Gate Bridge, officially opened in 1937, continues to stand as a remarkable landmark and a symbol of engineering prowess.</p>
                    <br> 
                    <hr>
                    <h3>Details</h3><p class="paragraph">The bridge's height is documented at 746 feet, making it the tallest suspension bridge until 1964. It features a driving length of 1.7 miles, accommodating six vehicular lanes and two pedestrian walkways. The overall span of the bridge measures 4,200 feet.</p>

                    <h3>50th Anniversary</h3>
                <p class="paragraph">In 1987, San Francisco marked the 50th anniversary of the Golden Gate Bridge's inauguration. Over 300,000 individuals crossed the bridge in celebration, while around 800,000 took part in the festivities. The day commenced with "Bridgewalk '87," which served as a reenactment of "Pedestrian Day '37," attracting an estimated 300,000 participants to the roadway. The bridge was closed to vehicular traffic starting at 5 am, and from 6 am to 10 am, pedestrians were permitted to access the roadway.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph">Painted Ladies are a collection of houses adorned in various colors, attracting the interest of millions of visitors during their trips to San Francisco.</p>
                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <p class="paragraph">San Francisco builders began erecting Victorian houses in the mid-1800s. The term "Painted Ladies" refers to the Victorian and Edwardian homes constructed during the 19th century. Thousands of these houses were built, but the construction came to an abrupt halt in April 1906. In 1963, one homeowner painted his residence in vibrant hues, including a mix of blues and greens. This architectural style became increasingly popular, and the application of various colors contributed to their visibility and uniqueness. The nickname "Painted Ladies" was popularized by a book released in 1978 that focused on these Victorian and Edwardian homes. Today, many homeowners continue to use bright paint colors to accentuate the beautiful details of these historic properties.</p>

                    <h2>3.<a href="https://www.sftravel.com/things-to-do/attractions/iconic-sf/lombard-street" target="_blank"> Lombard Street</a></h2>
                    <img src="img/lombard-photo.jpg" alt="Lombard street high view">
                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <p class="paragraph">Lombard Street ranks as one of San Francisco's most historic thoroughfares, tracing its origins back to the Gold Rush era of the mid-1800s. Established in 1853, it drew its name from Lombard Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The name Lombard is derived from the affluent and flourishing Italian region of Lombardy.</p>
                    <img src="img/lombard-history" alt="Lombard street">
                    <h3>Driving</h3>
                    <p class="paragraph">Drive through San Francisco's twisty road, Lombard Street. The most curviest road in San Francisco with eight harpin turns.
                        Cruising along Lombard Street can be a thrilling adventure, yet it poses its own set of difficulties. The sharp curves and continual stream of visitors render it a pathway that demands precise steering.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <h3>Take a Walk</h3>
                        <p class="paragraph">For those who wish to take in the sights without the burdens of driving, the walkways provide a safer, though steep, route to appreciate the street's distinctive layout and breathtaking views. The avenue is exquisitely adorned with florals and greenery, particularly hydrangeas, adding vibrant color against the gray asphalt. This careful landscaping, along with the red-brick pathway, forms a charming tableau, especially during the spring and summer seasons when the blossoms are at their peak.</p>
                        <img src="img/lombard-flowers" alt="flowers">
                    <h3>Safety</h3>
                    <p class="paragraph">The street has greatly caused an appearance in movies and is talked about when mentioning San Francisco, but the question asked is why the road is curved. The answer is for safety. The road is steep and the curves in the street reduce the danger of driving straight.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h3>Fun Fact</h3>
                    <p class="paragraph">While many travelers visualize Lombard Street as the most curved road in San Francisco, the truth is that it lies behind a different street. <a href="https://www.dangerousroads.org/north-america/usa/5400-vermont-street.html" target="_blank">Vermont Street</a> holds the title of the most twisty street in San Francisco and quite possibly in the entire U.S. It is sited near McKinley Square, between 20th and 22nd streets, and is a descending one-way road. It’s a thrilling winding street to navigate, much like Lombard Street. Keep a firm grip on your steering wheel and avoid bringing inexperienced drivers to this roadway.</p>

For those who love to hike, this destination is absolutely essential. The redwood trees are renowned for being the tallest on Earth, soaring to heights of up to 379 feet. These magnificent giants are located exclusively along a narrow coastal strip in California and Oregon. Intriguingly, redwoods exhibit fire resistance and can actually flourish after a fire, as it helps to clear out the underbrush and promotes seed germination. Be sure to immerse yourself in the enchanting trees and the incredible hiking paths that provide an unforgettable experience.</p>

The Muir Woods National Monument, commonly referred to as the Redwood Grove, stretches 12 miles to the north of San Francisco within Marin County. It was named to celebrate the naturalist John Muir, who proclaimed the site to be “the finest tribute to tree enthusiasts that could ever be discovered in all the woodlands on Earth.”</p>

                    <p class="paragraph">The designation "Alcatraz" was derived from "Alcatraces," which means “Island of the Pelicans", a name given by the Spanish navigator Juan Manuel de Ayala in 1775. Alcatraz officially opened its doors on August 11, 1934. It has served various purposes throughout its history, including that of a fortress, a military correctional facility, and a high-security federal prison. Alcatraz Island hosts the site of the decommissioned federal penitentiary, the oldest functioning lighthouse on the U.S. West Coast, early military defenses, and natural attractions such as tidal pools and a colony of seabirds.</p>

                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <p class="paragraph">Chinatown of San Francisco is the oldest Chinatown in the United States established in 1848. The struggles of life in China drove numerous people to flee the country in pursuit of better economic prospects for their survival. Immigrants traveled to San Francisco, hoping for a new beginning to clear their debts or support relatives left behind. As the largest commercial port on the West Coast, San Francisco became the primary entry point for Chinese immigrants recruited as laborers for the development of the western territories. Historically, San Francisco made several attempts to dismantle Chinatown. To maintain their community within the city, the Chinese shaped their environment into an 'Oriental City'. They created a unique skyline for Chinatown, which quickly grew into a popular tourist destination.</p>
